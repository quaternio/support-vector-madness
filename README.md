Training an SVM from scratch! 

Implements the sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm [introduced by J. Platt](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/sequential-minimal-optimization-a-fast-algorithm-for-training-support-vector-machines/) to solve the SVM dual problem.
Currently configured to use either a linear or a gaussian kernel.
